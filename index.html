    <h4> Cricket </h4>
    <p> Playing cricket has helped me develop qualities like <b> effort, determination, and team spirit</b>.<br>
        Cricket encourages each player to understand their team members, and this development makes them
        more <b>supportive</b> and works towards the greater good.</p>
