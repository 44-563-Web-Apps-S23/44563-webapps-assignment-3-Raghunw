        Born and raised in Hyderabad, India.<br> After completion of my undergraduate in Electronics and Communications
        from Osmania University, I've been to Ireland to start my career in Software.<br> During my studies in Ireland,
        visited France and Germany with my friends and explored a lot.

    <h4> One of my favourite book is Atomic Habits </h4>
    <p>
        Atomic Habits is a great book for anyone who is starting their path to making behavior changes.
        Even if you've already been working on habits for years, the book is a good refresher course in what matters,
        and
        can help you reaffirm your commitment to building up the behaviors that run your life, one habit at a time.
        James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is
        the
        guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones.
